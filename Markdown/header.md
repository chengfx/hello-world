In this file, I want to describle how to add titles in a file using a Markdown syntax.
we can use the symbol '#' to indicate where it starts a header. For example, if we want to add header1, we can wirte
>#This is Header1.
the effect of above sentence is 
#This is Header1.
As we've seen, It's so easy. Now, if we want to add Header2 or Header3 or Header4, what else I need to do is just add another symbol '#' at the beginning of the sentence. for example,
>##This is Header2.
>###This is Header3.
>####This is Header4.
>#####This is Header5.
>######This is Header6.
the effect of above sentences is 
##This is Header2.
###This is Header3.
####This is Header4.
#####This is Header5.
######This is Header6.
So, it's so easy that we can use it anywhere. However, what will happen if we add more than six symbol '#' at the beginning of sentence?
>######There are six symbol '#'.
>#######There are seven symbol '#'
######There are six symbol '#'.
#######There are seven symbol '#'
As we've seen, It seems as if it isn't work as we thought. The maximum level of header used in Markdown is 6.
