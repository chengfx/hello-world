In this file, I will describle how to emphasize our contents and add lists in files.
###1. *Emphasizing* our contents
 if we want to use text formatting, such as bold or italics, we can use the symboles '*' and '_' to surround texts which we want to strong.

	*single asterisks*
	_single underscores_
	**double asterisks**
	__double underscores__

the effect of above sentences is

*single asterisks*  
_single underscores_  
**double asterisks**  
__double underscores__  
	
if we want to use both bold and italic,we can do in the following format

	**_double asterisks and one underscore_**
	***triple asterisks***
	__*double underscores and one asterisk*__
	___triple underscores____
	or
	*__one asterisk and double underscores__*
	_**one underscore and double asterisks**_
	
the effect of above sentences is  
**_double asterisks and one underscore_**
***triple asterisks***
__*double underscores and one asterisk*__
___triple underscores____
or
*__one asterisk and double underscores__*
_**one underscore and double asterisks**_

###2. *Adding* lists
