In this file, I will describle how to emphasize our contents and add lists in files.
###1. *Emphasizing* our contents
If we want to use text formatting, such as bold or italics, we can use the symbols '*' and '_' to surround texts which we want to emphasize.

	*single asterisks*
	_single underscores_
	**double asterisks**
	__double underscores__

the effect of above sentences is

*single asterisks*  
_single underscores_  
**double asterisks**  
__double underscores__  
	
if we want to use both bold and italic,we can do in the following format

	**_double asterisks and one underscore_**
	***triple asterisks***
	__*double underscores and one asterisk*__
	___triple underscores____
	or
	*__one asterisk and double underscores__*
	_**one underscore and double asterisks**_
	
the effect of above sentences is 
**_double asterisks and one underscore_**  
***triple asterisks***  
__*double underscores and one asterisk*__  
___triple underscores____  
or 
*__one asterisk and double underscores__*  
_**one underscore and double asterisks**_  

###2. *Adding* lists
List can be divided into two forms, unordered list and ordered list. For unordered list we can using the symbols '*', '+' or '-'. 

	* using the symbols '*' at the beginning of the sentences
	+ using the symbols '+' at the beginning of the sentences
	- using the symbols '-' at the beginning of the sentences
	
the effect ot above sentences is 
* using the symbols '*' at the beginning of the sentences
+ using the symbols '+' at the beginning of the sentences
- using the symbols '-' at the beginning of the sentences
for ordered list we will use the following form

	1.first
	2.second
	3.third
	
the effect ot above sentences is 
	
1.first
2.second
3.third
