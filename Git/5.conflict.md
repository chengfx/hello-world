#Conflict
Now we can have many parallel branchs. Just assuming we've done differnt things in the same file in the 
different branchs, so what it will be when we merge these branchs. Conflicts will be faced because Git
doesn't know how to merge it.
##Sloving conflict

	Assuming I type this line in the branch master.
	Assuming I type this line in the branch branch1.

So when we type the following instruction 
	
	$git merge branch1
	
we can see

	Auto-merging Git/5.conflict.md
	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in Git/5.conflict.md
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

As I've described above, we need to slove conflict. when we type "git status", we can see

	On branch master
	You have unmerged paths.
	(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
	(use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
	Unmerged paths:
	(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
		both modified:   5.conflict.md
	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
	
And in this file ,we can see

	<<<<<<< HEAD
	##Sloving conflict
	Assuming I type this line in the branch master.
	=======
	Assuming I type this line in the branch branch1.
	>>>>>>> branch1
	
Now we have to slove it by hand, and then commit it.
