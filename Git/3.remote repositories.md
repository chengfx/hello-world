#Remote repositories
git is a distributed version systems. How to create repositories on ourselves machines has been introduced. Maybe you will be very curious about "distributed". This
file will tell you how to use the feature "distributed" of git.

First,we should create one repository at reomote servers. [GitHub][1] is one of good choices for us. When we completely create one repository at remote servers, we
could type the following instruction to add the remote repository.

	$git remote add origin "the address of the remote repository"

Now the name of the remote repository is origin. we push our code to remote repository through the following instruction.

	$git push -u origin master
	
the effect of the above instruction is 

	Counting objects: 4, done.
	Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 412 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
	Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
	remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
	To https://github.com/chengfx/hello-world.git
	e29f1a1..51ef1c8  master -> master

The function of parameter "-u" is set the default branch we need to push. After that we can type the following instruction to do the same thing.

	$git push
