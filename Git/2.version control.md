#Version control
Git has lots of useful functions which needs us to know. As I've said, Git is a version control system, so
this file will introduce how git control vesions.
##the logs of version
Assuming that we want to revist the past version we had commited to git. Then how can we do for it? The 
following instruction will save us.

	git log
	
when we type above instruction in our git bash, we may see some informations appearing in Bash such as

	commit abd6e31cc11ca1e79f0073b466ae854b74740279

	commit 8a5835b7b495555b3782ce84968c930be48e76ce

	:

or we can add parameter "--oneline"

	git log --oneline
	
So we can see informations every one line

	abd6e31 Changing the fileNames in Markdown
	8a5835b Changing the fileNames in Markdown

These can help us search vesion we need. The number "abd6e31" or "8a5835b" can be thought as the 
indices of versions , which can help us locate vesion we need quickly.

##Backward
Now we can list the logs of verison through the instructions we have learnd. we can go backward any version
we want.
