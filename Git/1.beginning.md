#Introduction
Git is a deistrubuted version control system, originally written by Linus Torvalds to manage the source code of the Linux kernel. I want to use it from now 
so that I write some usages on it for avoiding forgetting how to use it.
#Downloading and installing
Git can be got on the [Git-Downloads][1]. Lots of helps can be achieved on this website. First of all, we should download the latest git version which is 
suitable for our operating system. Then we install it on our computer.
#Some steps before using it
Some things need us to do before using it. Git need us name and email so that other people can know who are we when we share codes on the Internet. When we
open git bash,we can type the following instructions

	$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	$ git config --global user.email "youremail@xxx.com"
	
#Creating our git repository
Repository is a place which holds our codes. Before creating it we should make a folder

	$ mkdir HelloWorld
	$ cd HelloWorld
	
Then we type the following instruction

	$ git init
	
An empty git repository is created well by us.

#Adding files

	$git add myFile.txt
	
#Committing

	$git commit -m "This is first commit"
